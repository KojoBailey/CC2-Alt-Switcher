# CC2-Alt-Switcher
This is developed for *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R*, but may also work for other games by **CyberConnect2** that use the same engine.

The purpose of this tool is for modded players to easily switch the Tint Colour (aka "alt") that their `col` texture mod replaces via a simple drag-&-drop!

## Usage
Simply drag the `col` file you want to switch onto the tool's EXE file.

You will then need to specify which alt you want, input by letter (A, B, C, D, etc.)

After that, just press `enter` and watch the magic happen! The tool will create a new file without replacing the old one which you can then use like any other mod file.
