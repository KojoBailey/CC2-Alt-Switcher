# CC2 XFBIN Alt Switcher
This is developed for *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R*, but may also work for other games by **CyberConnect2** that use the same engine.

The purpose of this tool is for modded players to easily switch the Tint Colour (aka "alt") that their `col` texture mod replaces via a simple drag-&-drop!

## Usage
Simply **drag** the `col` XFBIN file you want to switch **onto** the tool's EXE file. At this time, **only** `col` files are supported. `bod` files will come soon!

You will then need to specify which alt you want, input by letter from **A - J**. Both uppercase and lowercase are supported inputs. Trying to enter any other value will result in an error.

After that, just press `enter` and watch the magic happen! The tool will create a new file without replacing the old one which you can then use like any other mod file.
